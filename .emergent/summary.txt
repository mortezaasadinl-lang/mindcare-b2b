The initial request was to build a professional, modern, high-trust, single-page website for PsyTech, an AI-driven mental health assessment platform targeting B2B partners in Europe.

The core requirements included:
- **Website Sections:** Hero, Problem, Solution, How It Works, Key Benefits, Unique Selling Points, Market Focus, Impact, Team, and a Call to Action.
- **Design:** A clean, minimal, premium, and trustworthy design with a dark or neutral/professional color palette (blue/teal/white), strong typography, and a mobile-first approach.
- **Functionality:** A Request a Demo or Partner with Us CTA.

**Subsequent features requested by the user:**
- **Contact Form:** A detailed contact form with email notifications.
- **Team Section:** Specific roles for team members, updated names, real photos, and LinkedIn profile links.
- **Blog/Insights:** A blog section () with an admin panel to manage posts.
- **AI Content Generation:** A scheduled cron job to automatically generate and publish two blog posts per week (text and image), with an option to enable/disable auto-publishing.
- **Social Media Integration:** Trigger a Make.com webhook upon post-publication to enable cross-posting to LinkedIn and Instagram via Buffer.
- **Multilingual Support:** Full i18n for English, Dutch, Persian, Turkish, Arabic, French, and German, including a language selector with flags.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - Replace an initial Netherlands map with a more dynamic SVG map of Europe that highlights the Netherlands.
    - Update the contact email to .
    - Improve the language selector UI to show flags and abbreviations.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in **English**. The next agent MUST continue the conversation in English.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed using a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database. The website includes all the requested informational sections, a functional blog with an admin interface, and multilingual support infrastructure.

- **Backend:** A FastAPI server with endpoints for contact form submission, CRUD operations for blog posts, a password-protected admin section, and an API to trigger AI content generation.
- **Frontend:** A responsive React application built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. It features routing for the blog, a post-management admin page, and a language selector in the navigation bar.
- **Integrations:**
    - AI text and image generation are integrated using the Emergent LLM Key.
    - A Make.com webhook is configured to be called when a blog post is published.
    - Resend integration for email is set up but currently blocked.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was actively implementing the final part of a major feature request: activating a fully automated AI content generation system. This involved creating a cron job in the backend to run twice a week (Monday & Thursday at 10:00 CET) to generate, publish, and trigger the social media webhook for a new blog post. The agent had updated the team photos and was in the middle of modifying  to add the  logic.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent. The agent should first manually trigger the generation endpoint to confirm a post is created and saved to the database. Then, it needs to validate the cron job itself, which may require checking logs or the database after the scheduled time to ensure a new post was created, published, and the webhook was triggered.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Finish Cron Job Implementation (Priority: P0)
- **Issue 2:** Full Translation of Static Content (Priority: P1)
- **Issue 3:** Resend Domain Verification (Priority: P2, Blocked)

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:** Finish Cron Job Implementation
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent started adding  to  but did not complete the implementation before the session ended. The code is partially written.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review  to see the incomplete scheduler code.
        2.  Complete the implementation by adding the , defining the cron job with the correct schedule ( for UTC, which is 10:00 CET in winter), and starting the scheduler on application startup.
        3.  Install  and add it to .
        4.  Restart the backend server using backend: stopped
backend: started.
        5.  Verify the cron job is active, either by checking logs or manually triggering the endpoint and observing the results.

**All files of reference**
- ****: The central backend file containing all API logic. **It is currently being modified to add the cron job.**
- ****: Stores all API keys and environment-specific configuration, including the Resend key and Make.com webhook URL.
- ****: Contains the team member information and was recently updated with real photos and LinkedIn URLs.
- ****: Contains the Europe map SVG and was recently updated to meet user requirements.
- ****: Configures the internationalization library.
- ****: This directory holds the translation files that need to be populated.
- ****: Contains the detailed project requirements and history.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Static Content Translation:** Most of the informational sections (e.g., , ) still contain hardcoded English text. They need to be refactored to use the  hook for full multilingual support.

**key api endpoints**
- : Submits the contact form.
- : Retrieves a list of published blog posts.
- : Retrieves a single blog post.
- : Authenticates an admin user.
- : (AUTH) Creates a new post.
- : (AUTH) Updates an existing post.
